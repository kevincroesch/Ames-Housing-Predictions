# Ames Housing Predictions

In this challenge, we use the well known Ames housing data to create a regression model that predicts the price of houses in Ames, IA.

> **Dataset description:** Ames Housing data

## Objectives

1. To predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, we must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

2. Obtain the Data - Data was provided for us. The data set contains more than 70 columns representing features of homes, and more than 2000 rows - each representing a unique real estate property

3. Explore the Data
  - Check and fix values
  - Check and fix dtypes
  - Check shape and description
  - Plot histogram, heat maps, pair plots, and box plots.
  - Sort values to view outliers
  - Choose features that we feel will best optimize our model performance
  
4. Model the Data
  - Instantiate and fit a model to best observe if the data is able to predict price
  - repeat process using different regression techniques to see if we can imrove our model
  
5. Evaluate the Data
  - Run various regression evaluation metrics to test the efficacy of our model
  
6. Predict prices and make reccomendations for how the information can be used
